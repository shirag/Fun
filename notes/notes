C++
----

1. For string s, using s[index], you can not insert element into the string. You
   can just read. But, not write into it.
   Where as swap(a[10], b[10]) => is good.
2. For maps, the order of insertion is not maintained. e.g, when you iterate 
   over the map after insertion, you cant retrieve it in the order in which it 
   was inserted.
3. For maps always use find() to find if an element exists and never use []. You might end up over writing.
   For finding if a map contains one element mp.count() != 0 instead of mp.find != mp.end()
4. For looping over containers using iterators, use macros to keep it simple.

5. If you want to remove all the duplicates in a vector and sort them, 
   then copy the vector to a set and copy it to a vector back again. This will achieve what you want to achieve.
   
6. Never ever modify the key value while traversing a map.

7. The std::find() and std::count() take O(N). So, try avoiding them for set and map. 
   In those cases, use container's appropriate functions since they use O(log n)
   
8. To traverse a container:
   #define tr(container, it) \ 
      for(typeof(container.begin()) it = container.begin(); it != container.end(); it++) 
      
9. string::erase(it) function always deletes the character at that location and 
   moves all character by one location to the front. So, after this operaton, it will 
   point to the same location. But, new content will occupy the same location. But then there no gurantee.
   So, its best to do something of the following and discrard any iterator that points to elements 
   after the element erased.

   
10. string to int - stoi()
    int to string - to_string()
    Is a string palindrome: os == string(os.rbegin(), os.rend());
    Min heap: priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> q;
    Second parameter: Container object is the second class template parameter 
    (the type of the underlying container for the priority_queue; by default: vector<T>).
    You can not iterate over queue elements.

11. Two problems with pointers:
    1. Memory it points to, is gone(dangling pointer).
    2. Pointer pointing to a memory is gone.
    With reference counting mechanism(a kind of smart pointer), the memory is not released if there is at least one referance.
12.  Smart pointers: They look like regular pointers. But they also release memory/object they are pointing, automatically.
     Smart pointers ensure that when an pointer pointing to an object is destoyed, the corresponding object is also destoyed.    
     e.g: Unique pointer(no copy allowed), shared pointer(ref counting mechanism), 
     weak pointer(pointing to shared, but does not have count towards ref count).
     
     Code snippet:
     
     int mySmartPointerDemo()
     {
         //with regular pointer
         int *ptr = new int(10);
         cout << *ptr << " \n" ;
         delete ptr;
         
         unique_ptr<int> ptr1(new int(10));

         return 0;
     }  
     If you try to copy unique pointers it will lead to compile time errors.

     
     
13. RAII: Resource acqusition is initialization: Locally created vectors dont have to destroyed. When an object goes out of scope,
    destructor gets called and releases memory resources.     
     
13. Can I have a virtual destructor? 
    To sum up, always make base classes' destructors virtual when they're meant to be manipulated polymorphically.
    If a class has any virtual function, then it should have a virtual destructor.
    If a class does not have any virtual function then it should have a virtual destructor.
    This is because it will increase the size of the object by creating an extra vtable.
 
14. There is no such thing as virtual constructors.

15. Overloading is breadth. Overriding is going down(inheritance).

16. What is 'this' pointer? Inside a member function, 'this' returns the pointer to the member object.   

17. C/C++
    1. C++ provides STL.
    2. Very hard to achieve inheritance in C.
    3. C does not provide exception handling.
    4. C does not have the concept of references.
    
18. What are virtual functions?
    Virtual functions are used to achieve inheritance. Virtual functions are called according to the type of 
    object a pointer is pointing(referencing) to instead of type of the pointer(reference). 
    Virtual functions are resolved at runtime.   
    If a class has virtual functions then it is meant to be used a base class.
    
19. Difference between copy constructor and assignment operator.
    The copy constructor is for creating a new object. It copies a existing object to a newly constructed object    
    The assgignment operator is for assigning values to an existing object. This might mean desroying existing object.
    
20. What is Return Value Optimization(RVO)?
    string fn1(string b)
    {
        string a;
        return a;
    }
    main()
    {
        string b = fn1();
      
    }
    If you dont enable RVO in this case, we might end up calling the copy contructor of string twice. If you enable RVo, then compiler 
    manipulates the code such that there is no copy. 
    void fn1(string& a)
    {
        a.append(); 
        return;
    }
    main()
    {
        string b;
        fn1(b);
  
    }
    When is it not applied? return cond ? first : second; (first and second are two strings)
21. Four types of design patterns: Creational(factory), Structural(proxy), Behavioral(observer), and Concurrency(scheduling).    
22. Design patterns:
    1. Name 2. Problem(context where it might be applied). 3. Solution(defines objects and describes how they interact). 
    4. Consequences: Results and tradeoffs.   



        
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Array/string sizes and index

no of elements/size(including current index) = currIndex - startIndex;
no of elements/size(excluding current index) = currIndex - startIndex - 1;

Dummy nodes/Sentinel: very good when you want to have a dummy node in front of a linked list

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bit wise operator:
1. Turn ON a bit(HONOR)
   x |= 0x01 => LSB is turned ON.
   x |= (1 << n) => nth bit in the variable x is turned ON. n is no of moves.
        (x >> n) => x is moved to RIGHT by n no of moves.
2. Turn OFF a bit(OFFENDNOT)
   x &= ~(1 << n) => nth bit is turned OFF
3. To test a bit is ON.
   if(x & (1 << n)) => TRUE is nth bit is ON
4. Toggle a bit:
   x ^= (1 << n) => nth bit is flipped/toggled.
5.        OR   AND  XOR(when two are distinct)
    0  0   0   0    0   
    0  1   1   0    1
    1  0   1   0    1
    1  1   1   1    0
    
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++ memory model:

Producer-Consumer problem:
Two main problems:
1. Producer should sleep when the buffer is full. Consumer should sleep when the buffer is empty.
   Consumer should wake up there is 1 unit of data in the buffer. Producer should wake up when there
   is one unit of space available in the buffer. We should achieve this by producer and consumer 
   sending signal to each other. If this is not done properly we might end up sleeping forever.
2. You should properly protect the field that indicates how much data is present in a buffer using a 
   proper mutex. 
   
   For one you should use a condition variables. But, then condition variables also have to be properly
   protected using a mutex.
   
3. Primitives for protecting access to portions of memory: Mutex
   Primitives for allowing synchronization(block one thread until the other one does something) 
     between threads: Condition Variables. 
   A condition variable must always be paired with a mutex. When it waits for a mutex, it gives up the condition variable. 
   when the condition is met, it automatically gets themutex back again.

Video Notes:

H.264:
 1. What are frames? I, P and B.
    Independent frame. Least compresed. You dont need other frames to decode it.
    P frame. Needs previous frames to decode it. It uses the I frame that comes before it to decode the frame. More compressed that IFrame
    B frame. can use previous a forward to decode it. It uses the I frame that comes before it and after it to decode itself. Most compressed.
    A slice: It is more spatial term. Is a spatially distinct region of a frame that is encoded separately from any other region in the same frame. 
    There are I-slices, P-slices, and B-slices.
 2. Profiles and levels?
    Profiles address the problem of code complexity and processing power.
    BMH:
    CEll phone use baseline
    STBs use Main Profile.
    Blueray uses high profile.
    Levels address the problem of bandwidth, max resolution, and memory issues on the decoder side
    Low end device(processor and memory), low bitrate, small screen size: go for baseline profile and lower levels
    High end device(processor and memory), high bitrate, bigger screen size: go for aseline profile and lower levels
     
 3. How do you reduce data?  Within and image and within a series of images.
 4. What is block based coding? Or what are macroblocks?
    Macro block is a processing unit.
 5. What block based motion compensation? What is coding the motion vector? (P frames)
 6. What is intra-prediction?
 * Most efficient encoder. In terms of bit-rate.
 * Also very high resilience to error.
 
HLS:

DASH:
  Media Presentation Desription File contains link to period description files.
  Period files contain link to Adapatation description files(camera angle, language etc).
  Adaptation description files contain link to bitrate info files.
  Bit rate info files contain link to actual video files(fragemented Mp4 files)
  
  
MP4:


* Acceptable 1080p stream using H.264 (AVC) compression at around 6 Mbps. 
  All else being equal, a 4K video would require 4x the bandwidth of a 1080p video (24 Mbps).
  With efficient Codec you can bring it down to 15mbps. With Mediamelon you can bring it to 10mbps.
  
* Norbert questions:
  * What all hardware configurations we do? What is prerolling from device point of view?
  * How does Iframe only mode work?
  * fmp4 against regular MP4 
  * How do you initialize flow proxy and decoder proxy? What is the difference at a high level?
  * How do we play with buffering level etc in the case of newer pipeline?
    Water mark model?
    In our case when would we show the spinning wheel"
    High water mark and lowe water mark: We start playing when we reach the high water mark. 
    But, we would pause when we go below the low water mark. Wait unti we hit the high water mark gain.
  * Licensing terms.
  * Do you know anything about GStreamer's streaming threads.
  * We were disabling prerolling after the first playback. Becuase of this after a seek we were not 
    able to wait for ASYNC_DONE message.

  * Networking:
   Unicast: from one source to one destination i.e. One-to-One 
   Broadcast: from one source to all possible destinations i.e. One-to-All 
   Multicast: from one source to multiple destinations stating an interest in receiving the traffic i.e. One-to-Many 
   
   Why TCP against UDP for VoD streaming:
   1. TCP provides reliability. Sends the packet again if there is a drop of packet.
   2. TCP provides network buffers.
   3. TCP connections oriented. So, helps with security.
   4. TCP's bandwidth probing and congestion control will attempt to use all of the available 
      bandwidth between server and client, fetching content as quick as possible while being friendly
      to other (TCP) traffic on the same links.
      
   Other advantages of TCP:
   * in-order delivery of data to the application. 
   * Since TCP builds a buffer, TCP also has to ensure that its buffer does not overflow. This is ensured using 
     flow-control where receiver tells the sender if the buffer is full.
   * TCP offers congestion control. It means keeps increasing its send buffer window sizes until 
     it sees packet drops.  
   * With TCP server needs a socket connection for every TCP receivert where as with UDP server can talk to multiple UDP receivers
     using the same socket.   
      
   RTSP: Realtime streaming protocol. Session control protocol for streaming video. TCP based.
   RTP: Realtime Trasport protocol. used with RTSP to stream video data. UDP based.
   RTCP: Realtime Trasport Control protocol. Goes with RTP. It provides QoS for RTP.
     
   What is the difference between HTTP POST and PUT
   PUT is replacing the current website(look and feel).
   Post is adding some content to fields of a document.

Bufferuing Using Gstreamer:
1. Application PAUSES the pipeline when it sees a buffering % below 100%.
2. Application PLAYSBACK using the pipeline when it sees a buffering = 100%.
* How does the application receive this message? The pipeline has to send it. How does the pipeline do it?
  It can have a low and high water mark. When the buffer level hits the high water mark, we can send the 100% message. 
  When it goes below the low water mark, it sends less than 100% message. It will wait until hits the high water mark again to send 100%.
* How do you configure the low and high water marks?
  1. Fixed time: We always want buffer for these many seconds.
  2. Fixed size: We always want buffer these many bytes.
* NULL state: Default state.
* READY state: Default resources(run-time libraries and memory) available. NULL to ready, allocate all non-stream specific resources.
* PAUSED state: It is ready and can handle data.    

GStreamer High Level Flow:
1. Initialize an element(class init/bin init)
2. Set properties.
3. State Trasitions: Tells when to allocate resources.
                      NULL to ready - Memory, library etc(All proxies: resman, winman, flowproxy).
                      READY to PAUSED - Decoder resource allocation.
                       
4. Once in paused state, it can receive events(seek, caps, newsegment event)
   caps event says what kind of decoder it is?
   newsegment indicates samples from new duration.
5. Chain calls. Receives video samples..
6. Now you can send messages to bus.
7. Answer any query like duration etc.
8. somebody can do a get property call.

* Scheduling mode: At OTV We did a push based shceduling mode. The src element would create a thread and push. Src pad would receive the chain function and in turn do a 
  a push of data on their sink pad.
  Pull based mode, the src pad would start a task and every src pad would support a function where you would get a range of bytes. 
  This would be used in cases where downstream element wants the control the data flow and requests only those many byes from the 
  upstream element.
