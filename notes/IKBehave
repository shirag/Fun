Elevator Pitch
  Hi, I'm Raghav. I used to work as Sr Software Engineer at Nagra. I have a lot of interest in [Video and streaming software] development.
  My most recent experience has been building [HTML5 based video player using GStreamer framework] for an Embedded Linux platform. 
  [Video using Javascript] is what excites me the most. 
  I am open for challenging work that uses my vast experience. It is very important for me to work with smart people.
  Everything falls in place when you have good people around you.

[Challenging Project: Video player development using Gstreamer Framework, OTT-MP4 playback]

Business context:
    Opentv5 is a middleware is built on embedded Linux OS and HTML5 with all digital television components.
    Gstreamer is used for media playback. This enables all the FOSS plugins to be reused instead of developing from scratch.
    
Main design:
    The challenge here is to  convert control only pipeline to control + data pipeline(Broadcast based solution that had lot of acceleration).
    Re-use the existing pipeline that was built for NON-OTT playback for OTT playback.  
    
My role:
    OTT-MP4 feature develpment. Build src, decontainer and decoder plugins/bins for the pipeline, integrate them, and unit test.  
    Implement basic player features like seek etc. Undertstand and learn Glib programming, and Gstreamer Framework in a very short timeframe.
    Also do research as to timings of the notifications to be sent to the player and Gstreamer states.
     
    As soon as you set the pipeline to a playing state it goes through various interim states before reaching the PLAYING state.
    Proper resource allocation should be done in proper states(stream specific and non-stream specific). There can be events coming in that
    indicates a CAPS(decoder configuration) and SEGMENT(AU time stamp).  Proper plugin code should be written to handle this.
    
    Player sets the pipeline to playing state. Using the ASYNC_DONE to send stream_started notification to external apps.
    If there is start from non-zero offset request, then upon the receipt of ASYNC_DONE we would do an immediate seek.
    We turn off pre-rolling after going to  playing state. Down side of it is we dont know when the set_position completion takes place.
    Then we came out with a polling mechanism to detect the position change. 
    
    Memory leak detection using scripts and Valgrind etc. Optimization and stabiliatione and productize.

    
[Challenging Project: Update to a newer version of GStreamer] 

Business context:
    More support for soup for MPEG DASH
    Optimization in terms of number of copies. 
Main design:
My role in it:
    Follow the cookbook techniques.
    Use some of the new features.
    Support all use cases.
    Solid unit test frame work
    Ensure all the OTT pipelines work properly and pass all unit tests.
    
    
*********************************************************************************************************************
[Challenging Project: YouTube PlayBack + DIAL Integration]
Business context:
   Integration of YouTube App with STBs and pass all certification tests.
Main design:
   Modify/implement player functionality, MSE support in WebKIT and OpentV player and GStreamer framework. 
   Use the existing OTT pipeline to playback YouTube video.
My role in it:
   Be accountible for some of the trick mode aspects of the certfication[Cancel a seek when a seek is going on]
   Also, ensure that DIAL end to end features work. Inegrate Netflix DIAL code etc. 
   and be accountible. Able to go over javasript test code to identify test cases and criterion for passing.
   Also ensure live related Youtube aspects work properly. 
   Resolve all the issues around start from non-zero offset when playing using DIAL.
   Handle the part where data transfer between webkit process and pipeline porcess transfer takes place.
   Feed the pipeline with the appropriate source segment and flush the shared memory when a seek takes place.
   EOF logic. How to handle that properly?

[Challenging Project: Application Manager Window Manager Support for STBs]
Business context:
   Ability to run multiple applications on an STB. There was a requirement to run Netflix in backfground mode.
Main design:
   Applications create windows using DirectFB and window manager is aware of all windows present in the system and their 
   states in terms of visibility, z-order and focis. Application manager queries the 
   state of the app with WinMan performs action accordingly. Listen to DirectFB graphics calls using SaWMan interface 
   and control the GUI and what applications are running. 
My role in it:
   Own the WinMan code and design APIs and be the go to person.
   Restacking logic: When a window is raised to top all the associated windows also should be raised properly.
   Restacking takes place ensure that right window gets the focus.

[Challenging Project: DVBST and DVB teletext Subtitle support for OpenTV framework]
Business context:
HLS streams have DVBST and DVB Teletext embedded in them.

Main design:
Main port existing libraries and integrate with our Gstreamer framework.
My role in it:

Eride GPS experience:

There is BBRAM to which you write the RTC offset when the receiver is shut down. When the receiver is turned ON again,
it reads the offset from the BBRAM gets the accurate time and performs all the calculation. One of the application of time is to 
find out if the ephemeris is valid or not. 

RecPlay software is used to tune GPS algorithms. You record measurements and record positions calculated. Later for the same measurements 
you try to produce positions again and see if it makes a difference.
